# Updated-LRR-Reynolds-stress-model-in-OpenFOAM
The existing LRR Reynolds stress model in OpenFOAM(R) was modified based on literature. The modified code files are useful to simulate turbulence-driven secondary currents in supercritical flows in rectangular or square channels and comparable duct flows.
